# Selection Sort Algorithm

A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
Selection sort does not adapt to the data in any way, so it's runtime is always O(N^2).
However, selection sort has the property of minimizing the number of swaps. In
applications where the cost of swapping items is high, selection sort very well
may be the algorithm of choice.

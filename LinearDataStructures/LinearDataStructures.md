# Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures are data structures that are linear in nature. They contain a list of elements that are connected linearly. The elements are connected by pointers. The list is terminated by a null pointer.

## Singly Linked List

The singly linked list is a data structure that contains a list of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The list is terminated by a null pointer.

The singly linked list is implemented in the file `LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList.h` and `LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList.cpp`.

### Node Implementation for Singly Linked Lists

The node is a data structure that contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The node is implemented in the file `LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList/Node.h` and `LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList/Node.cpp`.

## Doubly Linked List

The doubly linked list is a data structure that contains a list of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node and the previous node. The list is terminated by a null pointer.

The doubly linked list is implemented in the file `LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList.h` and `LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList/DoubleLinkedList.cpp`.

### Node Implementation for Doubly Linked Lists

The node is a data structure that contains a value and a pointer to the next node and the previous node. The node is implemented in the file `LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList/Node.h` and `LinkedList/DoublyLinkedList/Node.cpp`.

## Sinlgly Circular Linked List

The singly circular linked list is a data structure that contains a list of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The list is terminated by a null pointer. The last node points to the first node.

The singly circular linked list is implemented in the file `LinkedList/SinglyCircularLinkedList.h` and `LinkedList/SinglyCircularLinkedList.cpp`.

### Node Implementation for Singly Circular Linked Lists

The node is a data structure that contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The node is implemented in the file `LinkedList/SinglyCircularLinkedList/Node.h` and `LinkedList/SinglyCircularLinkedList/Node.cpp`.

## Doubly Circular Linked List

The doubly circular linked list is a data structure that contains a list of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node and the previous node. The list is terminated by a null pointer. The last node points to the first node.

The doubly circular linked list is implemented in the file `LinkedList/DoublyCircularLinkedList.h` and `LinkedList/DoublyCircularLinkedList.cpp`.

### Node Implementation for Doubly Circular Linked Lists

The node is a data structure that contains a value and a pointer to the next node and the previous node. The node is implemented in the file `LinkedList/DoublyCircularLinkedList/Node.h` and `LinkedList/DoublyCircularLinkedList/Node.cpp`.

## Stack

The stack is a data structure that contains a list of elements. The elements are added to the top of the stack. The elements are removed from the top of the stack. The stack is implemented in the file `Stack.h` and `Stack.cpp`.

## Queue

The queue is a data structure that contains a list of elements. The elements are added to the end of the queue. The elements are removed from the front of the queue. The queue is implemented in the file `Queue.h` and `Queue.cpp`.

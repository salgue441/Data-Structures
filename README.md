# Documentation of Data Structures

This repository contains the data structures for easier further implementation of the algorithms. The data structures are implemented in C++20.

## Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures

Implementation of the linear data structures is in the `LinearDataStructures` folder.

[Linear Data Structures](LinearDataStructures/LinearDataStructures.md)

### Non Linear Data Structures

Implementation of the non linear data structures is in the `NonLinearDataStructures` folder.

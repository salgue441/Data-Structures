# Documentation of Data Structures

This repository contains the data structures for easier further implementation of the algorithms. The data structures are implemented in C++20.

## Data Structures

### Node Implementation

The node is a data structure that contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The node is implemented in the file `Node.h` and `Node.cpp`.

### Singly Linked List

The singly linked list is a data structure that contains a list of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node. The list is terminated by a null pointer.

The singly linked list is implemented in the file `SinglyLinkedList.h` and `SinglyLinkedList.cpp`.

### Doubly Linked List

The doubly linked list is a data structure that contains a list of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node and the previous node. The list is terminated by a null pointer.
